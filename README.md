# animations
A resource for sharing animation, plotting code etc.

Describe your script here

### himawari_cloud_animation.py

Authors: Mathew Lipson, Samuel Green

Himawari-8 Cloud Type Animation, based on Sam Green's example:
https://21centuryweather.github.io/21st-Century-Weather-Software-Wiki/datasets/himawari-ahi.html

In the script, change ## USER INPUT ## section as requried

Note with 10 minute outputs animation file size can be large over longer periods. 

### rain_accum_animation.py

Author: Mathew Lipson

This will load a netcdf and plot each time period with:
 - instantaneous rain rate
 - cumulative precipitation

It is set up for my file system, so you will need to edit for your needs, but 
the basic functions should be transferable
